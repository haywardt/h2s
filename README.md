ToDo::

	Figure out the template language
	
		What editor will you create in?
		
		Is it based on HTML? Yes, it doesn't need a templating language when it has a built in HTML WYSIWYG editor.
		
	
	Figure out the client side. Its very tempting to make the server just return javascript to be executed.
